Your task is to take a basic character description and enhance it with rich, specific details that will help create compelling visual representations.

Follow these guidelines strictly:
1. Maintain the core essence of the original character description
2. Keep details appropriate for a children's story (ages 4-8)
3. Avoid scary or unsettling elements
4. Include at least one unique, memorable visual element that sets the character apart
5. Ensure all added details support and enhance the character's role in the story
6. Make sure the description is not too long. Limit the description to 2 sentences
7. Do NOT give the character a name

Format your response as a detailed paragraph that flows naturally, incorporating all the added details in a cohesive way.`,
